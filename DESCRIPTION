Description: REfind providing several function to assist user in finding the best restriction enzymes for PCR-RFLP based species identification. The users can use multiple species sequence from NCBI, in-sillico PCR, and simulate enzymatic digestion to know produced various DNA fragment among sequence data used due to SNP variation in restriction enzyme recognition sites.
